# Pumpkins vs. Undead

A Halloween-themed PWA browser game where you have to place pumpkins and other botanic defenses to keep the waves of undead away.

Drag-and drop pumpkins and other defenses on the grid to defend the house from the undead.
The last line of defense is a set of cars, which will flatten out the undead in that lane upon triggering.
The cars are replenished every round.

The game operates based on rounds & waves. Stats are reset per round, with multiple waves to survive.

Maple trees are the primary source of energy, leaves.
Spend leaves on defenses.

Using the Remove tool will partially refund a pumpkin.
